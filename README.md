We have created `Elepantry` Tagging Space to let you easily find the files on your cloud drives.

One place in which you can connect all of your cloud storages, `tag` the files and easily search for them.

Elepantry is the one arm man knife for your files in the cloud, just log in with your `Google Account` and start tagging!

If you have files on other cloud drives, thatâ€™s not a problem!

You can connect your `Dropbox`, `Azure OneDrive` and `Amazon S3` accounts and manage your files in one place.

You can display your tagged resource in variety of `views` based on chosen criteria, i.e.:

* SiFi books in `MOBI` or `PDF` format

* Horrors in any format: books, audio-books, movies

* Pictures of my family made at home
